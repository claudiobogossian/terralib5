BRANCHES  Notes on how to switch to the right branch to work on: MASTER, DEVELOP or any tagged release.


1. Branching
------------

Three branches are essential in Terralib/terraview: "develop", "release-x.x.x" and "master":
  - develop: this is the branch where the development team are working together to reach a "desirable" point.

  - release-x.x.x: this branch is created from "develop" when a desirable point is reached by the team and a new release should be prepared to be tagged. 

  - master: reflects a production-ready state where a tag (x.x.x) should be created after merge it with the "release-x.x.x" branch.

Also there are tags which, usually are originated from a release branch: 5.0.0-alpha, 5.0.0-beta, 5.0.0, 5.0.1 and so on.
     
2. After cloning terralib5 git repository, the current branch is always "master". To work on in a specific branch or released-tag, use the following git commands to help you:

a) To check all branches available (remotes and local) and see the current one marked with "*".
   $ git branch -a  
   *master                           -- *master -> means the current branch is master
   remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
   remotes/origin/develop
   remotes/origin/master
   remotes/origin/release-5.0         (from this branch all tags 5.0.x will be generated)
   remotes/origin/release-5.0.0-alpha
   remotes/origin/release-5.0.0-beta
   
b) To switch to one of the branches listed above, use the checkout command (syntax and example bellow)and create a local branch to track the remote branch
   $ git checkout -b <local_branch_name> <remote_branch_name without this part "remotes/">  
   $ git checkout -b develop origin/develop   

c) To check all tags available, use:
   $ git tag -l                  (list all tag names)
   5.0.0-alpha
   5.0.0-beta
   5.0.0
   5.0.1
   ...
   
d) It is also possible to checkout a specific tag and create a local branch to work on:
   $ git checkout -b <local_branch_tag_name> <one_of_tag_name_listed>
   $ git checkout -b tag_branch_5.0.1  5.0.1
   
e) After choosing the right branch to work on, follow the BUILD-INSTRUCTIONS.
