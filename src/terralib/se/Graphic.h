      \brief A Graphic is a graphic symbol with an inherent shape, color(s), and possibly size.

      A graphic can be defined very informally as "a little picture" and
      can be of either a raster or vector-graphic source type.
      The default if neither an ExternalGraphic nor
      a Mark is specified is to use the default mark
      of a "square" with a 50%-gray fill and a black
      outline, with a size of 6 pixels, unless an
      explicit Size is specified.

          Graphics can either be referenced from an external URL
          in a common format (such as GIF or SVG). Multiple
          external URLs and marks may be referenced with the
          semantic that they all provide the equivalent graphic
          in different formats. The "hot spot" to use for positioning
          the rendering at a point must either be inherent in the
          external format or is defined to be the "central point" of
          the graphic, where the exact definition "central point" is
          system-dependent.

          semantics as the "stroke-opacity" and "fill-opacity"

          The Size element gives the absolute size of
          the graphic in uoms encoded as a floating-point
          number. The default size for an object is
          context-dependent. Negative values are not allowed.

          The default size of an image format (such as GIF)
          is the inherent size of the image. The
          default size of a format without an
          inherent size (such as SVG which are
          not specially marked) is defined to be 16 pixels in
          height and the corresponding aspect in width.
          If a size is specified, the height of the graphic
          will be scaled to that size and the corresponding
          aspect will be used for the width. An expected common
          use case will be for image graphics to be on the order
          of 200 pixels in linear size and to be scaled to lower
          sizes. On systems that can resample these graphic
          images "smoothly", the results will be visually pleasing.

          The Rotation element gives the rotation of
          a graphic in the clockwise direction about its
          center point in decimal degrees, encoded as a
          floating-point number. Negative values mean
          counter-clockwise rotation. The default value
          is 0.0 (no rotation). Note that there is no
          connection between source geometry types and
          rotations; the point used for plotting has no
          inherent direction. Also, the point within the
          graphic about which it is rotated is format
          dependent. If a format does not include an
          inherent rotation point, then the point of rotation
          should be the centroid.
