<h3 style="text-align: center; font-family: Calibri Light;">TerraView
Main Concepts</h3>



<span style="font-family: Calibri Light;"></span>
<h4 style="font-family: Calibri Light;">Project</h4>



<span style="font-family: Calibri Light;">Project is a physical
file (*.tview) that defines the workspace of a user keeping the minimal
information about the layers. For each layer added to the project, only
a reference to the&nbsp;datasource where the layer is stored and its
visual characteristics are serialized in this file.&nbsp;<br>



<br>



</span>
<h4 style="font-family: Calibri Light;">Data Sources</h4>



<span style="font-family: Calibri Light;">TerraView supports
different data sources such as:<br>



</span>
<ul style="font-family: Calibri Light;">



  <li>Databases: created under PostGIS or&nbsp; Microsoft Access database managment.</li>



</ul>



<ul>



  <li><span style="font-family: Calibri Light;">Directory of Files:&nbsp; vector files (shp, kml, etc) or raster files (tiff, jpeg, etc).</span><span style="font-family: Calibri Light;"></span></li>



</ul>



<span style="font-family: Calibri Light;"></span>
<h4 style="font-family: Calibri Light;">Layers</h4>



<span style="font-family: Calibri Light;">Layers are the representation
of the datasets inside TerraView application. Each layer correspond to
a vector, raster, or tabular dataset stored in a database.</span><br style="font-family: Calibri Light;">



<ul style="font-family: Calibri Light;">



  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">DataSetLayer</span>: This is the
most common type of layer. Layers of this type have one data set that
belongs to a data source and can be a vector or raster data.&nbsp;</li>



</ul>



<ul style="font-family: Calibri Light;">



  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">FolderLayer</span>: This type of
layer is used to facilitate the organization of layers in the Layer Explorer, allowing the grouping of layers.</li>



</ul>



<ul style="font-family: Calibri Light;">



  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">QueryLayer</span>: This type of
layer is used&nbsp;to create a subset of a DataSetLayer. For example, when a
restriction clause&nbsp; over a dataset is defined, it generates a new dataset that is represented by
this type of layer.</li>



</ul>



<ul style="font-family: Calibri Light;">



  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">TabularLayer</span>: This type of layer
is used to show a dataset represented in textual files with well-defined
format such as CSV, or even binary files of type DBF. These files may
or may not have geometric representations.</li>



</ul>



<h4 style="font-family: Calibri Light;">Layer Explorer</h4>



<span style="font-family: Calibri Light;">Layer explorer is&nbsp;a tree
structure used to&nbsp;present the layers contained in a project. A
folder layer is an element in this tree with layers inside it. A
context
menu is provided (righ click mouse) to quickly access relevant
operation to each layer type.<br style="font-family: Calibri Light;">



</span>
<h4 style="font-family: Calibri Light;">Data Table</h4>



<span style="font-family: Calibri Light;">Data Table is&nbsp;used to&nbsp;present the textual data associated with each layer. Some context
menus are also provided to access the relevant operations in a row, line etc.<br>



<br style="font-family: Calibri Light;">



</span>
<h4 style="font-family: Calibri Light;">Map Display</h4>



<span style="font-family: Calibri Light;">The Map Display is the area
used to render the selected layers. It can have its own SRID (set or
unset) or by default it take the first valid SRID among the selected
layers.<br>



<br>



</span><span style="font-family: Calibri Light;"></span>
<h4 style="font-family: Calibri Light;">Style</h4>



<span style="font-family: Calibri Light;">The style defines how
a layer should be rendered in the Map Display. For each type of
geometric representation (line, point, polygon) a style can be set. &nbsp;A
style is defined by a set of rules and the rules&nbsp;are composed of
sets of symbolizers.</span><br style="font-family: Calibri Light;">



<br style="font-family: Calibri Light;">



<ul style="font-family: Calibri Light;">



  <li>Rules: It is possible to define a set of rules within a style,
allowing different parts of the layer to have different visual. The
rule is a filter to be applied to the layer.</li>



</ul>



<ul>



  <li><span style="font-family: Calibri Light;">Symbolizers: Structure
that defines how an object should be rendered. Attributes such as fill
color, opacity and others are defined in this element. A symbolizer can also be
represented by an image file or well-known mark.</span></li>



</ul>



<span style="font-family: Calibri Light;"><br style="font-family: Calibri Light;">



</span>
<h4 style="font-family: Calibri Light;">Style Explorer</h4>



<span style="font-family: Calibri Light;">Style Explorer displays the style associated
with a layer in a interface where it is possible to add, remove or modify the
symbols that make up the style. A property browser displays all
attributes of a selected symbol and it is modifiable.&nbsp;<br>



<br style="font-family: Calibri Light;">



</span>
<h4 style="font-family: Calibri Light;">SRS / SRID</h4>



<span style="font-family: Calibri Light;">SRS stands for Spatial
Reference Systems and SRID defines an unique if for a spatial
reference. To correctly render a&nbsp;Layer&nbsp; in a Map Display it
is necessary to have&nbsp;consistent SRIDs (projections) for both the
Map Display and the Layer.<br>


<br>



<br style="font-family: Calibri Light;">



</span>
<h4 style="font-family: Calibri Light;">Plugins</h4>



<span style="font-family: Calibri Light;">Plugins are modules of
TerraView that can easily be associated with or removed from the
application. An example of these plugins are the drivers that support different data sources.</span>
