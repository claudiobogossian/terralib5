      \brief A convenient and more compact way of encoding the very common bounding box constraint based on an envelope.

      It is equivalent to the spatial operation
      Not Disjoint, meaning that the BBOX operator
      should identify all geometries that spatially
      interact with the box. If the optional
      m_property element is not specified,
      the calling service must determine which
      spatial property is the spatial key and
      apply the BBOX operator accordingly. For
      feature types that has a single spatial
      property, this is a trivial matter. For
      feature types that have multiple spatial
      properties, the calling service either
      knows which spatial property is the spatial
      key, or the calling service generates an exception
      indicating that the feature contains multiple spatial
      properties and the m_property element must be specified.
      Of course, a client application always has the
      options of avoiding the exceptions by calling
      the DescribeFeatureType operation to get a description
      of the feature type.
