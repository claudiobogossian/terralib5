      \brief A class to represent units of measure.

       The use of a unit of measure is meant to encompass the means by which a 
       measured value is tied explicitly to its unit of measure.

       Units of measure can be Base or Derived. Base units are well-defined units 
       which by convention are regarded as dimensionally independent. There is only 
       one Base Unit per type of measure.

       Derived units are those formed by combining base units according to the algebraic 
       relations linking the corresponding quantities.

       Units have an unique numerical identification, an oficial name, a symbol, the
       type of measures that they refer to and an optional description. Derived Units 
       also have the identification of its Base Unit and 4 factors to relate them,
       using the following formula:
       \code
       Y = (AX + B) / (CX + D)
       \endcode
       where Y is the measure in the derived unit and X is measure in base unit.
