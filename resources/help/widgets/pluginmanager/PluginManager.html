The plugin manager are used to control the plugins that can be used in
the system. The costumers of this component
can perform the following operations:
<ol>

  <li> Enable a plugin that is disabled </li>

  <li> Disable a plugin that is enabled </li>

  <li> Add new plugins </li>

  <li> Remove existing plugins </li>

</ol>

<p align="justify">Note that none operations will remove
or create physical files, removing a plugin will only remove its
reference on plugin manager. The following figure shows the plugin
manager component:
</p>

<p align="center"> <img alt="Plugins Manager" src="../../helpimages/widgets/pluginmanager/main.png" align="middle">
</p>

<p align="justify"> Each line presented in the table
represents a plugin in the system. Note in the "enabling" column that
there are some plugins checked and others are not. These means that the
plugins, that are checked, are loaded and the others are not.

<strong> <span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">Loading
and unloading plugins</span> </strong> </font>
</p>

<p align="justify"> Loading and unloading plugins changes
its original state, to reflect the modification in the list, these
items modification are showed in the user interface, marking the lines
modified, putting its font as bold. These modifications are not valid
until the user press the button apply. After that the "original" state,
of the marked plugins changed. The following figure shows some plugins

<p align="center"> <img alt="Enable plugins" src="../../helpimages/widgets/pluginmanager/enable_disable.png">
</p>

<p align="justify"> Important note, when enabling plugins
all of its dependencies have to be loaded either. If some dependency
was not loaded, the manager will try to recover it of its own list. If
this dependency exists in the list, the manager will question the
client about the load of the dependency. If the client answer "no" for
the question then the plugin will NOT be loaded, otherwise continue
asking for other dependencies. If all dependencies are satisfied then
the plugin will be loaded. For disabling, if a plugin to be disabled
has dependents, all its dependents will also be unloaded, unless the
client answer "no" to the question. </p>

below:
</p>

<p align="center"> <img alt="Adding plugins" src="../../helpimages/widgets/pluginmanager/adding.png">
</p>

<p align="justify"> When the client press the add button,
a dialog with options of addition will be shown. Valid plugins has a
manifest file with extension <strong>(TerraLib plugin *.teplg)</strong>.
The dialog with options of adding files is the following
</p>

<p align="center"> <img alt="Adding files" src="./adding_files.png">
</p>

<p align="justify"> The client must choose a directory or
a file. A directory must contain a list of manifest files for plugins.
Each one will be loaded to memory. Add plugins does not means that
these plugins will be loaded. The add operation just adds the plugin to
list of unloaded plugins. To enable it, the client must enable it at
the list as we said above in the section of loading and unloading.
Plugins added are present in font bold. </p>

<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">
<strong> <span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">Removing

</p>

<p align="justify"> To remove plugins, select the plugins
to remove and press the button remove shown in the following figure:
</p>

<p align="center"> <img alt="Removing plugins" src="../../helpimages/widgets/pluginmanager/removing.png">

as disable fields. Plugins to be removed are presented as the ones in
the following figure.
</p>

<p align="center"> <img alt="To remove plugins" src="../../helpimages/widgets/pluginmanager/to_remove.png">
</p>

<p align="justify"> Removing plugins do not remove the
physical files, it only remove reference in its list. The manager will
stop then unload the selected plugins. Stop the plugin means that it
will be unload and acts exact as said above in the section loading and
unloading plugins. All its dependents will be unloaded after the client
answer "Yes" for unloading questions.
</p>

<strong> <span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">Broked
plugins</span> </strong> </font>
</p>

<p align="justify"> Plugins that are broken are plugins
which have dependencies missed. For some reason its dependencies can
not be load. This kind of plugin will be showed in the manager without
the check enabling button, because it can not be loaded. To revert this
situation of a plugin, the client must load all of the dependencies of
the plugin.
