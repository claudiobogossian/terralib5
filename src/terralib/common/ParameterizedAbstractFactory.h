      \class ParameterizedAbstractFactory

      \brief This class defines the basic interface of an abstract factory that makes use of parameters to construct the objects.

      The parameterized abstract factory keeps an internal dictionary for
      accessing its concrete factories. A concrete factory is identified
      by a key of type TFACTORYKEY. This type must be copy constructible.
      
      It will create objects of type TPRODUCT and will pass
      parameters of type TPARAM to their constructors.
      
      Note that TPRODUCT is the object type that
      the factory knows how to create. The TPARAM type is the type
      of parameters accepted by the objects being constructed. In order
      to create your abstract factory, the concrete
      classes will have to extend the build method.
      When an object from a concrete factory is created, it is automatically
      registered in the abstract factory.

      If you do not need to initialize the objects created by the factories, try to use
      a derived class from AbstractFactory instead.
