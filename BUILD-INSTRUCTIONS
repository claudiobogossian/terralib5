  TerraLib Build Instructions
  ===========================


The build/cmake folder contains a CMake project for building TerraLib.

Until now its build has been tested on Linux Ubuntu 12.04, Mac OS X Mavericks and Microsoft Windows 7.

Future releases will be tested on Mac OS X Snow Leopard, Microsoft Windows 8 and others Linux flavours.

You should use at least CMake version 2.8.7 for building TerraLib. Older versions than this may not work properly.

Make sure you have all the third-party library dependencies listed in the DEPENDENCIES file on the root of the codebase.

Follow the build steps below according to your platform.


1. Build instructions on Linux with g++ (GNU gcc)
-------------------------------------------------

1.1. Open a Command Prompt (Shell).

1.2. We will assume that the codebase (all the source tree) is located at:
/home/user/terralib/codebase

1.3. Create a folder out of the terralib source tree, for example:
$ cd /home/user/terralib
$ mkdir build-linux
$ cd build-linux

1.4. For Linux systems you must choose the build configuration:
$ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING="Release" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH="/usr/local/terralib" ../codebase/build/cmake

Notes:

       a) Some Linux flavours with diffrent versions of GNU gcc and Boost will need more parameters:
          $ cmake ../codebase/build/cmake -G "Unix Makefiles"
                  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING="Release"
                  -DCMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH:PATH="/usr/local;/opt/include"
                  -DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH:PATH="/usr/local;/opt/lib"
                  -DCMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH:PATH="/usr/local/bin;/opt/bin"
                  -DBOOST_ROOT:PATH="/opt/boost"

       b) Boost can also be indicated by BOOST_INCLUDEDIR (note: without an '_' separating INCLUDE and DIR):
          -DBOOST_INCLUDEDIR:PATH="/usr/local/include"

       c) The parameter -lpthread must be informed only if your Boost was not built as a shared library:
          -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS:STRING="-lpthread"

       d) If you are using a CMake version before 2.8.11 the above command must be run twice in order to enable the right components.

       e) Some versions of Clang and gcc needs to add -ftemplate-depth-1024 to CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS.

       f) For building with Qt5 you can provide the Qt5_DIR variable as:
          -DQt5_DIR:PATH="/usr/local/lib/cmake/Qt5"

       g) For generating a debug version set CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE as:
          -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Debug

1.5 Building:
$ make -j 4

1.6 Installing:
$ make install

2. Building with CMake GUI
--------------------------



3. Eclipse on Linux
-------------------
