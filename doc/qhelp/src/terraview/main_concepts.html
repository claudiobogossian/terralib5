<h3 style="text-align: center; font-family: Calibri Light;">TerraView
Main Concepts</h3>

<span style="font-family: Calibri Light;">This new version of TerraView
introduces some new concepts. It is important for the new user to have
knowledge of these concepts, making it easier to adapt. Some of these
concepts are:</span>
<h4 style="font-family: Calibri Light;">Project</h4>

<span style="font-family: Calibri Light;">The project is a physical
file that defines the workspace of a user. All layers created by a user
are serialized in this file. Importantly, the data are not stored in
the project file, but just a link to where the data sources are located.<br>

<br>

</span>
<h4 style="font-family: Calibri Light;">Data Sources</h4>

<span style="font-family: Calibri Light;">The TerraView supports
different data sources such as:<br>

</span>
<ul style="font-family: Calibri Light;">

  <li>Databases: PostGIS, Microsoft Access, SQLite</li>

</ul>

<ul>

  <li><span style="font-family: Calibri Light;">Files: Files can either
be vector files as raster files. To support these data types, libraries GDAL / OGR are used.</span></li>

</ul>

<span style="font-family: Calibri Light;"></span>
<h4 style="font-family: Calibri Light;">Layers</h4>

<span style="font-family: Calibri Light;">Layers are the representation
of the data sets in TerraView. Initially there are some types of layers:</span><br style="font-family: Calibri Light;">

<br style="font-family: Calibri Light;">

<ul style="font-family: Calibri Light;">

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">DataSetLayer</span>: This is the
most common type of layer. Layers of this type have one data set that
belongs to a data source.</li>

</ul>

<ul style="font-family: Calibri Light;">

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">FolderLayer</span>: This type of
layer is used to facilitate the organization of layers in the Layer Explorer, allowing the grouping of layers.</li>

</ul>

<ul style="font-family: Calibri Light;">

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">QueryLayer</span>: This type of
layer is used&nbsp;to create a subset of a DataSetLayer. For example, when a
restriction clause&nbsp; over a dataset is defined, it generates a new dataset that is represented by
this type of layer.</li>

</ul>

<ul style="font-family: Calibri Light;">

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">TabularLayer</span>: This type of layer
is used to show a dataset represented in textual files with well-defined
format such as CSV, or even binary files of type DBF. These files may
or may not have geometric representations.</li>

</ul>

<h4 style="font-family: Calibri Light;">Layer Explorer</h4>

<span style="font-family: Calibri Light;">This component uses a tree
structure to represent the layers contained in a project. A context
menu is provided for quick access operations that are relevant to each
type of layer or sub element of this layer.<br>

<br style="font-family: Calibri Light;">

</span>
<h4 style="font-family: Calibri Light;">Data Table</h4>

<span style="font-family: Calibri Light;">This component is a table
used to represent the textual data associated with each layer. Context
menus are also provided to access the relevant operations.<br>

<br style="font-family: Calibri Light;">

</span>
<h4 style="font-family: Calibri Light;">Map Display</h4>

<span style="font-family: Calibri Light;">The map display is the area
to be used to render the selected layer in the layer explorer. This
component defines a geographical reference system to be followed by all
layers to be drawn in this component.<br>

<br>

</span><span style="font-family: Calibri Light;"></span>
<h4 style="font-family: Calibri Light;">Style</h4>

<span style="font-family: Calibri Light;">The style defines how
a&nbsp;data set should be rendered in the Map Display. For each type of
geometric representation exists a kind of style to set it. &nbsp;A
style is defined by a set of rules and the rules&nbsp;are composed of
sets of symbolizers.</span><br style="font-family: Calibri Light;">

<br style="font-family: Calibri Light;">

<ul style="font-family: Calibri Light;">

  <li>Rules: It is possible to define a set of rules within a style,
allowing different parts of the dataset to have different visual. The
rule is a filter to be applied to the data set.</li>

</ul>

<ul>

  <li><span style="font-family: Calibri Light;">Symbolizers: Structure
that defines how an object should be rendered. Attributes such as fill
color, opacity and others are defined in this element. A symbolizer can also be
represented by an image file or well-known mark.</span></li>

</ul>

<span style="font-family: Calibri Light;"><br style="font-family: Calibri Light;">

</span>
<h4 style="font-family: Calibri Light;">Style Explorer</h4>

<span style="font-family: Calibri Light;">Displays the style associated
with a layer. This component is possible to add, remove or modify the
symbols that make up the style. A property browser displays all
attributes of a selected symbol, simply allowing its modification.<br>

<br style="font-family: Calibri Light;">

</span>
<h4 style="font-family: Calibri Light;">SRS / SRID</h4>

<span style="font-family: Calibri Light;">SRS stands for Spatial
Reference Systems and SRID defines an identifier of a spatial
reference. To correctly render a DataSetLayer&nbsp; in a Map Display it
is necessary to have&nbsp;consistent SRIDs (projections) for both the
Map and the Layer.<br>
<br>

<br style="font-family: Calibri Light;">

</span>
<h4 style="font-family: Calibri Light;">Plugins</h4>

<span style="font-family: Calibri Light;">Plugins are modules of
TerraView that can easily be associated with or removed from the
application. An example of these plugins are the drivers that support different data sources.</span>
