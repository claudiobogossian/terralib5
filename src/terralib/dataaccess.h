  \defgroup dataaccess Data Access

  \brief The data access module provides a basic framework for accessing data.

  It is designed towards data interoperability. You can
  write your own driver for accessing a different data source.
  Of course, we provide some basic data sources drivers.

  The Data Access module provides the fundamental layer for applications
  that handle spatial data from different sources, ranging from traditional DBMSs to OGC Web Services.

  This module is composed by some base abstract classes that must be extended to allow the creation
  of Data Access Drivers which actually implement all the details needed to access
  data in a specific format or system.

  This module provides the base foundation for an application discover what is stored 
  in a data source and how the data is organized in it. Keep in mind that this organization is the
  low-level organization of the data. For instance, in a DBMS, you can find out the tables stored 
  in a database and the relationships between them or detailed informations about 
  their columns (data type, name and constraints).

  It is not the role of this module to provide higher-level metadata about the data stored in a data source.

  The namespace associated to the Data Access module is te::da. To know more about it, see the te::da namespace documentation.
