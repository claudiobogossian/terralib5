  TerraLib - Dependencies
  =======================

If you want to build yourself TerraLib then you need to install some third-party libraries.

For Microsoft Visual C++ users we have prepared a zip file containing all the third-party libraries in a binary format. You can download this package from:
http://www.dpi.inpe.br/terralib5-devel

In that folder you will find:
  - terralib5-3rdparty-win32.zip: all the third-party libraries for building a 32-bit version of TerraLib.
  - terralib5-3rdparty-win32-Qt4.zip: all the third-party libraries for building a 32-bit version of TerraLib with Qt 4 support.
  - terralib5-3rdparty-win32-Qt5.zip: all the third-party libraries for building a 32-bit version of TerraLib with Qt 5 support.
