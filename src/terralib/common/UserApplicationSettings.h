      \brief A singleton for managing application settings applied to a single user.

      This singleton can be used to keep user preferences that
      customize the application's appearance and behavior for a given user.

      It will look for an user configuration file as follows:
      <ul>
      <li>first, searchs for the user settings file name in the system application settings singleton</li>
      <li>if not found, use the file name defined by the macro TERRALIB_USER_SETTINGS_FILE</li>
      <li>then it check for this file in the current application dir under the folder TERRALIB_CONFIG_DIR</li>
      <li>if not found, it checks for in the user data dir (plataform dependent!)</li>
      <li>and finally it uses a location defined by an environment variable TERRALIB_DIR_ENVVAR and a sub-dir defined by the macro TERRALIB_CONFIG_DIR</li>
      </ul>
