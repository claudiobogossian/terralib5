      \brief ShadedRelief specifies the application of relief shading (or "hill shading") to a DEM raster to give it somewhat of a three-dimensional effect and to make elevation changes more visible.

      Exact parameters of the shading are system-dependent (for now).
      If the BrightnessOnly flag is "0" or "false" (false, default),
      the shading is applied to the layer being rendered as the current
      RasterSymbolizer. If BrightnessOnly is "1" or "true" (true),
      the shading is applied to the brightness of the colors
      in the rendering canvas generated so far by other layers,
      with the effect of relief-shading these other layers. The
      default for BrightnessOnly is "0" (false). The ReliefFactor
      gives the amount of exaggeration to use for the height of
      the "hills". A value of around 55 (times) gives reasonable results
      for Earth-based DEMs. The default value is system-dependent.
