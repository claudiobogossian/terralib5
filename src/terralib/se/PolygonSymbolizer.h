          \brief

          The Geometry element of a PolygonSymbolizer defines the linear
          geometry to be used for styling. The Geometry element is
          optional and if it is absent then the all geometry properties
          of the feature type that is used in the containing FeatureType
          are used. Most frequently, though, feature types will have only
          a single geometry property. See OGC te::fe::PropertyName
          class for more information on attribute names.
          If a polygon has "holes", then they are not filled, but the
          borders around the holes are stroked in the usual way. "Islands"
          within holes are filled and stroked, and so on. If a point geometry
          is referenced instead of a polygon, then a small, square, ortho-normal
          polygon should be constructed for rendering. If a line is referenced,
          then the line (string) is closed for filling (only) by connecting its
          end point to its start point, any line crossings are corrected in
          some way, and only the original line is stroked. If a raster geometry
          is used, then the raster-coverage area is used as the polygon. A missing
          Geometry element selects the "default" geometry for a feature type.

          \note Geometry types other than inherently linear types can
                also be used. If a point geometry is used, it should be
                interpreted as a line of "epsilon" (arbitrarily small) length
                with a horizontal orientation centered on the point, and should
                be rendered with two end caps. If a polygon is used (or
                other "area" type), then its closed outline is used as the line
                string (with no end caps). If a raster geometry is used, its
                coverage-area outline is used for the line, rendered with no end caps.
