#  Description: Find Gettext tools and macros for creating translations and templates
#
#  Author: Matheus Cavassan Zaglia
#          Frederico BedÃª
#
#  Notes:
#
#    There are three files created with the macros provided in this module:
#
#    POT File -> Template for translations, do not translate in this file.
#    PO  File -> Created from POT file, translations are made in this file.
#    MO  File -> Binary file of the PO file, this file will be used to translate your application.
#
#    The following macros use the GNU Gettext.
#    The GNU Gettext is available for Windows, Linux and MAC OS X at: https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/
#
#  Usage:
#
#    GETTEXT_CREATE_TRANSLATIONS(
#     terralib_unittest_core                        <--- Name of the translation
#     "TE_TR"                                       <--- Keyword that will be searched
#     "TE_TR_PLURAL"                                <--- Keyword for plural texts
#     "pt_BR"                                       <--- Translation locale
#     "${TERRALIB_ABSOLUTE_ROOT_DIR}/unittest/core" <--- Where the macro will search for the keyword)
