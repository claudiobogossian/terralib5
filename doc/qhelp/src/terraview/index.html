<span style="font-family: Calibri Light;">TerraView is a Geographic
Information System (GIS) that provides a
friendly interface allowing you to view and manipulate both vector and
raster data. This application was developed on top of TerraLib 5.0.0 geographic library which have been completely reengineered.<br>




<br>




In this new version of TerraView some concepts previously used have
changed and some new concepts were adopted.&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: Calibri Light;">

<br style="font-family: Calibri Light;">

<span style="font-family: Calibri Light;">A short explanation of these
concepts is presented <a href="main_concepts.html">here</a>. To know about the GUI TerraView visit this&nbsp;<a href="main_window.html">link</a>.<br>

<br>

It also presents new (or 
enhanced versions of)&nbsp; functions for data conversion and data exchanging;
 access to different data sources; map display; explanatory spatial data
 analysis; spatial and non-spatial queries; vector and raster processing
 and spatio-temporal analysis functionalities.</span><br style="font-family: Calibri Light;">
