/*!
  \brief All the TerraLib code is inside this namespace, and each module (or package) will add its own namespace.

  The use of namespace has several benefits, and we try to use it carefully.
  The rule used in TerraLib is very simple:
  <ul>
  <li>Each module has its own namespace;</li>
  <li>And all namespaces belong to the main namespace called <b>te</b>.</li>
  </ul>
  We recommend to avoid the C++ <i>using</i> keyword. For example, if you want to use
  a class called Exception located in the Common module, you can write a code like this:
  <br>
  \code
  te::common::Exception e("my exception text goes here...");
  \endcode

  and if you want to call a function, like Convert2String:
  <br>
  \code
  std::string mystring = te::common::Convert2String(67);
  \endcode
