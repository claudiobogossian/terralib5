      \class AbstractFactory

      \brief This class defines the interface of abstract factories without initializing parameters.

      The abstract factory keeps an internal dictionary (a singleton) to
      access their concrete factories.

      A concrete factory is identified by a key of type TFACTORYKEY.
      TFACTORYKEY must be copy constructible.

      It will create objects of type TPRODUCT.
      Note that TPRODUCT is the object type that the factory knows
      how to create.

      In order to create an abstract factory, the concrete
      classes will have to extend the build method.
      When an object from a concrete factory is created, it is automatically
      registered in the abstract factory.

      If you need to initialize the objects created by the factories try to use
      a derived class from ParameterizedAbstractFactory instead.

      \note This class is not thread-safe for multiple writers.
