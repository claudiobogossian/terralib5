      \brief A PointPlacement specifies how a text label should be rendered relative to a geometric point.

      For a PointPlacement, the anchor point of
      the label and a linear displacement from the
      point can be specified, to allow a graphic
      Symbolizer to be plotted directly at the point.
      This might be useful to label a city, for example.
      The AnchorPoint element of a PointPlacement gives
      the location inside of a label to use for anchoring
      the label to the main-geometry point. The Displacement
      element of a PointPlacement gives the X and Y
      displacements from the main-geometry point to
      render a text label.
      This will often be used to avoid over-plotting
      a graphic symbol marking a city or some such
      feature. The displacements are in units of pixels
      above and to the right of the point. A system may
      reflect this displacement about the X and/or Y axes
      to de-conflict labels. The default displacement is
      X = 0, Y = 0.
      The Rotation of a PointPlacement gives the clockwise
      rotation of the label in degrees from the normal
      direction for a font (left-to-right for
      Latin-derived human languages at least).
