      \brief ChannelSelection specifies the false-color channel selection for a multi-spectral raster source (such as a multi-band satellite-imagery source).

      Either a channel may be selected to display in
      each of red, green, and blue, or a single channel
      may be selected to display in grayscale. (The
      spelling "gray" is used since it seems to be
      more common on the Web than "grey" by a ratio
      of about 3:1.) Contrast enhancement may be applied
      to each channel in isolation. Channels are identified
      by a system and data-dependent character identifier.
      Commonly, channels will be labelled as "1", "2", etc.
