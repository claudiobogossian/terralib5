What do you need before generating the installer?
=================================================

- For generate a TerraLib 5 installer you must have installed NSIS in your computer, 
that you can download through the links available at TerraLib 5 Wiki.
- You must have compiled TerraLib according to your needs (msvc2010-32, mingw-64)

How to build NSIS installer?
============================

- To create a Msvc2010-32bit, for example, you need to change the attributes "PLATFORM",
at TeConfig.nsh, to "32" and the attribute "GENERATOR" to "msvc2010", at MsvcConfig.nsh.
- At terralib_bin_msvc2010_32.nsi, name that will be changed, you need to comment the line
"!insertmacro MINGW_CONFIG".
