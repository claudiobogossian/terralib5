      \brief A Halo is a type of Fill that is applied to the backgrounds of font glyphs.

      A Halo fills an extended area outside the glyphs of a rendered
      text label to make the label easier to read over a background.
      The Radius element gives the absolute size of a halo
      radius in pixels encoded as a floating-point number. The
      radius is taken from the outside edge of a font glyph to
      extend the area of coverage of the glyph (and the inside
      edge of "holes" in the glyphs). The halo of a text label
      is considered to be a single shape. The default radius is
      one pixel. Negative values are not allowed. The default
      halo fill is solid white (Color "#FFFFFF"). The glyph’s
      fill is plotted on top of the halo. The default font fill
      is solid black (Color "#000000"). If no Halo is selected
      in the containing TextSymbolizer, then no halo will be rendered.
