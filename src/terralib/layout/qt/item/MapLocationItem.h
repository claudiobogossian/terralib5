   \brief This class is a proxy MapDisplay. This makes it possible to add a MapDisplay as item of a scene. 
   This object is of type QGraphicsProxyWidget. He have a directly interaction by user. 
   His transformation matrix is inverted, that is, the inverse of the matrix of the scene, so its coordinate system is screen (pixel), 
   but its position in the scene remains in millimeters.
   This is also son of ItemObserver, so it can become observer of a model (Observable). "View" part of MVC component.
