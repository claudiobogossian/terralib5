      \brief A Rule is used to attach property/scale conditions to and group the individual symbols used for rendering.

      Rules are used to group rendering instructions by
      feature-property conditions and map scales. Rule
      definitions are placed immediately inside of
      featuretype- or coverage-style definitions.
      If a rule has no Filter element, the
      interpretation is that the rule condition is
      always true, i.e., all features are accepted
      and styled by the rule.
      The ElseFilter has a more complicated interpretation
      than the Filter element, and is interpreted as follows.
      The nominal scale of the map to be portrayed is
      computed (as described in the previous subclause) and
      all rules for scale ranges that do not include the computed
      nominal scale are discarded from further processing. Then, the
      specific condition for the ElseFilter is computed by "or-ing"
      together all of the other filter conditions and take the
      global "not" of that condition.
