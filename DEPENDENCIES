  TerraLib - Dependencies
  =======================

If you want to build yourself TerraLib then you need to install some third-party libraries.

For Microsoft Visual C++ users we have prepared a zip file containing all the third-party libraries in a binary format. 
You can download this package from two places:
   - The tagged version:  
     http://www.dpi.inpe.br/terralib5/terralib5-3rdparty/terralib5.1.0-3rdparty-msvc-2013-win64.zip
           or
     http://www.dpi.inpe.br/terralib5/terralib5-3rdparty/terralib5.0.1-3rdparty-msvc-2013-win32.zip (not supported from 5.1.0)

   - The most updated version used by developers (only to work with develop branch): 
     http://www.dpi.inpe.br/terralib5-devel/terralib5-3rdparty-msvc-2013-win64.zip
           or
     http://www.dpi.inpe.br/terralib5-devel/terralib5-3rdparty-msvc-2013-win32.zip


In that folder you will find:
  - terralib5-3rdparty-msvc-2013-win64.zip: all the third-party libraries for building a 64-bit version of TerraLib with Qt 5.4.1 support.
  - terralib5-3rdparty-msvc-2013-win32.zip: all the third-party libraries for building a 32-bit version of TerraLib with Qt 5.4.1 support (not supported from 5.1.0).
