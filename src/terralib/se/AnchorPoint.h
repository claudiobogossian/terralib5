      \brief An AnchorPoint identifies the location inside of a text label to use an 'anchor' for positioning it relative to a point geometry.

      The AnchorPoint element of a PointSymbolizer
      gives the location inside of a Graphic (or label)
      to use for anchoring the graphic to the
      main-geometry point. The coordinates are given as
      two floating-point numbers in the AnchorPointX and AnchorPointY
      elements each with values between 0.0 and 1.0 inclusive.
      The bounding box of the graphic/label to be rendered is considered
      to be in a coordinate space from 0.0 (lower-left corner) to
      1.0 (upper-right corner), and the anchor position is specified
      as a point in this space. The default point is X = 0.5, Y = 0.5,
      which is at the middle height and middle length of the
      graphic/label text. A system may choose different anchor
      points to de-conflict graphics/labels.
