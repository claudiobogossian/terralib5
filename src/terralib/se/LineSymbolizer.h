          \brief

          The Geometry element of a LineSymbolizer defines the linear
          geometry to be used for styling. The Geometry element is
          optional and if it is absent then the all geometry properties
          of the feature type that is used in the containing FeatureType
          are used. Most frequently, though, feature types will have only
          a single geometry property. See OGC te::fe::PropertyName
          class for more information on attribute names.

          \note Geometry types other than inherently linear types can
                also be used. If a point geometry is used, it should be
                interpreted as a line of "epsilon" (arbitrarily small) length
                with a horizontal orientation centered on the point, and should
                be rendered with two end caps. If a polygon is used (or
                other "area" type), then its closed outline is used as the line
                string (with no end caps). If a raster geometry is used, its
                coverage-area outline is used for the line, rendered with no end caps.

          \brief

          PerpendicularOffset allows to draw lines in parallel
          to the original geometry. For complex line strings
          these parallel lines have to be constructed so that
          the distance between original geometry and drawn line
          stays equal. This construction can result in drawn lines
          that are actually smaller or longer than the original
          geometry. The distance is in uoms and is positive
          to the left-hand side of the line string. Negative numbers
          mean right. The default offset is 0.
