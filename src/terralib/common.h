  \brief The common module contains the foundation classes and functions for all TerraLib modules.

  The TerraLib Common Module contains the foundation classes and functions that makes the basic support for other TerraLib modules.
  It provides portable and cross platform code not focus exclusively in the geo-spatial domain.
  On the contrary, the helper classes, utilitary functions, generic class templates and generic design pattern classes
  are domain application neutral and can be used by any application.

  The TerraLib modules has made use of Boost libraries but some functionalities are not found in Boost, so the common runtime module fills this gap
  and add some low-level code used by TerraLib applications. You will find in this module classes for: abstract factories, singletons, visitors, support for i18n,
  message logging, shared library management, threading policies and much more.
  
  Besides the classes you will find useful routines for: byte swap, hex-encoding/decoding, platform specific routines, auxiliary functions for STL containers.

  The main classes/concepts in this module are listed here. The namespace associated to the Common module is te::common.
  To know more about it, see the te::common namespace documentation.
